# ArcadeNames_MiSTer

The arcade_names.txt-files provide translated core names for arcade cores in MiSTer FPGA, for its usage by other external tools. The aim is to build arcade_names-files for different regions.

Don't confuse this repository with the [Names repository from Threepwood](https://github.com/ThreepwoodLeBrush/Names_MiSTer), which renames the system names in the OSD. This project has a similar motivation but doesn't involve renaming in the OSD through the names.txt feature from the MiSTer firmware.
